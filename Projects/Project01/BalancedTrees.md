# Balanced Trees

This projects demonstrates the use of four types of balanced trees:
(a) AVL trees, (b) B trees, (c) Red-Black tree, (d) 2/3 tree. Each tree will
include a C++ implementation, and a test.cpp file will compare the execution 
time of searching 10 elements in a 100,000-element tree (all four tree types)
will be compared.
