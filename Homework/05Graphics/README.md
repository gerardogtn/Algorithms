## Graphic Algorithms

### Description

In this project we create a QT user interface that demonstrates the use of cubes,
cones, arcs, polygons, rectangular prisms and triangular prisms.

### How to guide

#### Open PRO file.
Download all the files in this directory and open the pro file on QT. Use the
play command (Cmd + R) to run. This is proven to work on Mac OS.

#### User guide
After opening the application, select the type of geometric figure you want to
work with. A blank screen we'll be opened in which you'll be able to see the figure,
and modify it. Possible modifications are: rotation, translation, and reflection.
